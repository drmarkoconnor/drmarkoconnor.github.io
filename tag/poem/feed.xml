In a corner of a far flung attic,
disguised by decades’ of dust,
you doggedly grip papers
together, tethered, trapped,
his last Will, a testament
to those he fought with.
&lt;br&gt;
My fingers, three generations on,
squeeze your sides.
Like Arthurian stone,
you release your sword
to one you recognise as your own.
Duty done, you snap back smartly,
Like a square bashed soldier, renewed for action.
&lt;br&gt;
You were the last thing he touched,
in the ditches of France,
entrusted with dark memories
of our freedom’s birth.
I see his fingerprints in the dust,
and place my fingers there,
two sides of the same sheaf.
I place you with his medals.
Its where he would want you
British Bulldog, rest in peace
&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt; “You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.” 
― Jane Austen&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sestina is a complex, thirty-nine-line poem featuring the intricate repetition of end-words in six stanzas and an envoi. The envoi, sometimes known as the tornada, must also include the remaining three end-words, BDF, in the course of the three lines so that all six recurring words appear in the final three lines - Although the form is arbitrary its enforced lexical repetition is an additional technique to rhythm and rhyme that keep’s the imagery of the idea within the poem alive and more interesting ( hopefully ) to the reader - let me know what you think . &lt;a

My dead father rests in cliched peace,
that in single life escaped him, most of the time.
Ashes now, but I imagine his sleep
to be good, like a man found not guilty in a trial.
He left me a large aspidistra pot,
stuffed full of poems, on each an avian mark.
&lt;br&gt;
Chipped, it also bears scratches and a mark
I recall from youth, five letters spelling peace,
initials too, (Peter and Olivia Thompson), ‘Peace POT.’
Two poor writers, with little sense of time,
artists of their present, but blind to future’s trial,
where one endures, the other silenced in sleep.
&lt;br&gt;
After mother died, I watched father in his sleep
with a tear stained face, and sensed the mark
of Caine upon his soul. On trial,
not knowing if he would find a peace,
his flesh in limbo, stuck for all time,
slow braised in hellish casserole pot.
&lt;br&gt;
Words, like fragile shoots from a flower pot,
grew slowly, and brought comfort to his sleep.
Pantoums, sestinas and sonnets beat time,
conducted by his pen to indelibly mark
each poem with a white dove, of peace,
an avian army of advocates that argued at his trial
&lt;br&gt;
and won. I know now why each poem and all the trial
attempts, he threw into that pot,
as if he knew would grow a protective kind of peace,
that prepared me for the nightmares of my sleep.
Writer warrior, his sword but a pen, to make his mark,
and create a memory of her time.
&lt;br&gt;
With each precious poem I read, over time,
I feel closer to one I never could trial,
a mother, whose breast my milk teeth couldn’t mark,
who now, in poetry preserved would never go to pot.
How I relish those times, whilst in my sleep,
Dad wrote of Mother's strokes throughout my slumbered peace.
&lt;br&gt;
When my time has come for blissful peace,
and I begin my trial of eternal sleep,
don't grieve, just mark me, please, with a poem in your pot.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;first day at school - a villanelle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Shared days entwined together bittersweet,
long labour, cord clipped, independent first cry.
Separate tracks play love’s synchronised beat.
&lt;br&gt;
Smooth soft skin, swaddled safely, suckling teat,
slow teasing tempo to sung lullaby.
Shared days entwined together bittersweet.
&lt;br&gt;
Children grow, sense perfume of first defeat.
See mothers prepare pensive sad goodbyes.
Separate tracks play love’s synchronised beat.
&lt;br&gt;
Gravel path grips soles of reluctant feet.
School’s silhouette breaks grey September sky,
shared days entwined together bittersweet.
&lt;br&gt;
Red bricked door, one path, smart uniform pleats
creased in play, new friends, youthful alibis,
separate tracks play love’s synchronised beat.
&lt;br&gt;
Bell tolls school’s end, I look to where we’ll meet.
Two pathways divergent for you and I,
shared days entwined together bittersweet.
Separate tracks play love’s synchronised beat&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; A decades old photograph - What is it we remember when all details are forgot?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;A Photo of Mum, found in a box marked 'to keep'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &quot;&gt;
Soft sunlight reflects her face fixed with pleasure, 
arranged by Dad, snapped with minimum fuss.
Frail yellowed paper holds her, captured,
enraptured, in a permanent maternal pose.
I place a kiss on her head and return her to the box
but hold the image a while, a reminder of a time now lost.
A memory, an image-blanket for my sleep, 
held close at heart, marked precious; one to keep.
&lt;/pre&gt;
